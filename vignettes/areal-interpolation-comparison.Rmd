## Introduction

Areal Interpolation may be defined as the process of transforming data reported
over a set of spatial units (source) to another (target). Its application to population 
data has attracted considerable attention during the last few decades. A massive amount 
of methods have been reported in the scientific literature. Most of them focus 
on the improvement of the accuracy by using more sophisticated techniques rather 
than developing standardized methods. As a result, only a few implementation 
tools exists within the R community.

One of the most common, easy and straightforward methods of Areal Interpolation 
is Areal Weighting Interpolation (AWI). AWI proportionately interpolates the 
population values of the source features based on areal (or spatial) weights 
calculated by the area of intersection between the source and the target zones.

[`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/) and
[`areal`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/areal/)
packages provide Areal Interpolation functionality within the R ecosystem. Both
packages implement (AWI). `sf` functionality comes up with extensive and 
intensive interpolation options and calculates the areal weights based on the 
total area of the source features (total weights). `sf` functionality is suitable 
for completely overlapping data. `areal` extends the existing functionality of 
the `sf` package by introducing an additional formula for data without complete overlap. 
In this case weights are calculated using the sum of the remaining source areas 
after the intersection (sum weights).
 
When the case involves Areal Interpolation of urban population data (small scale
applications) where the source features (such as city blocks or census tracts) 
are somehow larger than target features (such as buildings) in terms of footprint
area the `sf` functionality (total weights) is unable to calculate areal weights 
properly and therefore, is not ideal for such applications. `areal` functionality
may be confusing for novice R (or GIS) users as it is not obvious that the weight
option should be set to ``sum`` to calculate areal weights correctly.
 
To overcome these limitations [`populR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/populR) 
is introduced. `populR` is suitable for Areal Interpolation of urban population
and provides an AWI approach that matches the existing functionality 
of `areal` using ``sum weights`` and additionally, proposes a VWI approach which,
to our knowledge, extends the existing Areal Interpolation functionality within 
the R ecosystem. VWI uses the area of intersection between source and target 
features multiplied by the building height or number of floors (volume) 
to guide the interpolation process. 

In this vignette a comparative analysis of Areal Interpolation alternatives within the
programming environment of R is carried out. `sf`, `areal` and `populR` results
are obtained and further compared to a more realistic population distribution.

## Case Study

A small part of the city of Mytilini, Lesvos, Greece was chosen as the case study
(figure below).The study area consists of 9 city blocks (source) counting 911 
residents and 179 buildings units (target) including floor number information.
These data are included in `populR` package for further experimentation.


```{r sarea, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, fig.align = "center"}

# attach library
library(populR)

# load data
data('src')
data('trg')

source <- src
target <- trg

# plot data
plot(source['geometry'], col = "#634B56", border = NA)
plot(target['geometry'], col = "#FD8D3C", add = T)

```

## Implementation

In this section a demonstration of the `sf`, `areal` and `populR` packages takes place.
First, the packages are attached to the script and next `populR` built-in data
are loaded. Then, Areal Interpolation functions are executed for each one of the
aforementioned packages.

The ``st_interpolate_aw()`` function of the `sf` package takes:


1. ``x``: an object of class `sf` with data to be interpolated
2. ``to``: the target geometries (sf object) 
3. ``extensive``: whether to use extensive (TRUE) or intensive interpolation (FALSE)


`areal` provides the ``aw_interpolate()`` function which requires:


1. ``data``: an sf object to be used as target 
2. ``tid``: target identification numbers
3. ``source``: an sf object with data to be interpolated
4. ``sid``: source identification numbers
5. ``weight``: may be either ``sum`` or ``total`` for extensive interpolation and 
``sum`` intensive interpolation
6. ``output``: whether `sf` object or `tibble` 
7. ``extensive``: a vector of quoted (extensive) variable names - optional if 
    intensive is specified
8. ``intensive``: a vector of quoted (intensive) variable names - optional if 
    extensive is specified


Finally, `populR` offers ``pp_estimate()`` function which takes:

1. ``target``: an sf object to be used as target
2. ``source``: an sf object with data to be interpolated
3. ``sid``: source identification number
4. ``spop``: source population values to be interpolated
5. ``volume``: target volume information (number of floors or height) - required
for the vwi approach
6. ``point``: whether to return point geometries (TRUE) or not (FALSE) - optional
7. ``method``: whether to use awi or vwi


Evidently, `sf` package's `st_interpolate_aw` function requires only 3 arguments
which make it very easy to implement while `populR` requires at least 5 and `areal`
at least 7 arguments which potentially increases the implementation complexity.

On the other hand, only `areal` may be used for multiple interpolations at once
as the ``extensive`` or ``intensive`` argument takes a vector of quoted values 
(not included in this vignette).

For the reader's convenience names were shortened as follows:


* ``awi``: populR awi approach
* ``vwi``: populR vwi approach
* ``aws``: areal using extensive interpolation and sum weights
* ``awt``: areal using extensive interpolation and total weights
* ``sf``: sf using extensive interpolation


```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# attach libraries 
library(populR)
library(areal)
library(sf)

# load data
data('src')
data('trg')

source <- src
target <- trg

# populR - awi
awi <- pp_estimate(target = target, source = source, spop = pop, sid = sid, 
                   method = awi)
# populR - vwi
vwi <- pp_estimate(target = target, source = source, spop = pop, sid = sid, 
                   volume = floors, method = vwi)

# areal - sum weights
aws <- aw_interpolate(target, tid = tid, source = source, sid = 'sid', 
                      weight = 'sum', output = 'sf', extensive = 'pop')
# areal - total weights
awt <- aw_interpolate(target, tid = tid, source = source, sid = 'sid', 
                      weight = 'total', output = 'sf', extensive = 'pop')

# sf - total weights
sf <- st_interpolate_aw(source['pop'], target, extensive = TRUE)

```


## Results

The study area counts 911 residents as already mentioned in previous section. From
the code chunk below it is clear that ``awi``, ``vwi`` and ``aws`` 
correctly estimated population values as they sum to 911 while ``awt`` 
and ``sf`` results underestimated values. This is expected as both methods use 
the total area of the source features during the interpolation process and are 
useful when source and target features completely overlap. 

```{r}

# sum initial values
sum(source$pop)

# populR - awi
sum(awi$pp_est)

# populR - vwi
sum(vwi$pp_est)

# areal - awt
sum(awt$pop)

# areal - aws
sum(aws$pop)

# sf
sum(sf$pop)


```

Moreover, identical results were obtained by the ``awi`` and ``aws`` approaches and
somehow different results by the ``vwi`` as shown in the code block below.

```{r}

# order values using tid
awi <- awi[order(awi$tid),]
vwi <- vwi[order(vwi$tid),]

# get values and create a df
awi_values <- awi$pp_est
vwi_values <- vwi$pp_est

awt_values <- awt$pop
aws_values <- aws$pop

sf_values <- sf$pop

df <- data.frame(vwi = vwi_values, awi = awi_values, aws = aws_values,
                 awt = awt_values, sf = sf_values)

df[1:20,]

```


### Comparison to Reference Data

Due to confidentiality concerns, population data at building level are not available
in Greece. Therefore, an alternate population distribution previously published
in [Batsaris et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.4018/ijagr.2019100103) was used as 
reference data set to compare the results.

This reference population values are included in the built-in data set as shown below in the field ``rf``.

```{r}

target

```

In the code chunk below the first 20 features are presented for comparison.

```{r}
rf <- awi$rf

df <- cbind(rf, df)

df[1:20,]

```


`populR` provides a function (``pp_compare()``) to compare the results with alternate
population data. ``pp_compare()`` produces scatter diagram, linear regression model, correlation
coeficient ($R^2$), MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root 
Mean Squared Error) to investigate the relationship of the results with the 
reference (or other) data. 

Generally, the diagrams suggest strong and positive relationships 
in all cases. However, ``vwi`` provides the strongest relationship and $R^2$
coefficient. ``vwi`` provides the smallest MAE value in comparison with
the other methods as shown below.

```{r scatter, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7.2, fig.align = "center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

awi_error <- pp_compare(df, estimated = awi, actual = rf, title = "awi vs actual")
awi_error

vwi_error <- pp_compare(df, estimated = vwi, actual = rf, title = "vwi vs actual")
vwi_error

sf_error <- pp_compare(df, estimated = sf, actual = rf, title = "sf vs actual")
sf_error

awt_error <- pp_compare(df, estimated = awt, actual = rf, title = "awt vs actual")
awt_error

aws_error <- pp_compare(df, estimated = aws, actual = rf, title = "aws vs actual")
aws_error


```




RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is also calculated. Again, ``vwi`` provides
the smallest error value as shown in the code block below.



## Comparison on Performance

Finally, a performance comparison (execution times) is carried out in this 
section using [microbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microbenchmark/) 
package. Execution time measurements suggest that `populR` functionality executed
much faster than `areal` and `sf` as shown below. Both ``awi`` and ``vwi`` achieved
the best mean  execution time (about 76.74 milliseconds). ``aws`` follows with
136.67  milliseconds and finally, ``awt`` with 180.53 milliseconds.

```{r}

library(microbenchmark)

# performance comparison
microbenchmark(
  suppressWarnings(pp_estimate(target = target, source = source, spop = pop, sid = sid, 
                   method = awi)),
  suppressWarnings(pp_estimate(target = target, source = source, spop = pop, sid = sid, 
                   volume = floors, method = vwi)),
  aw_interpolate(target, tid = tid, source = source, sid = 'sid', 
                      weight = 'sum', output = 'sf', extensive = 'pop'),
  aw_interpolate(target, tid = tid, source = source, sid = 'sid', 
                      weight = 'total', output = 'sf', extensive = 'pop'),
  suppressWarnings(st_interpolate_aw(source['pop'], target, extensive = TRUE))
)


```


## Summary

In this vignette a demonstration and a comparative analysis of areal 
interpolation packages implemented in  urban population data is undertaken. 
`sf` and `areal` provide general purpose AWI functionality while
`populR` focuses on areal interpolation of population data. Additionally, `populR`
provides VWI which, to the best of my knowledge, extends R's existing functionality.

Mytilini, Greece was used as the case study to investigate three main pillars: 
a) implementation, b) results, c) performance.  Notes on implementation indicate 
that `sf` requires only 3 arguments to use while `populR` at least 5 and `areal` 7. 
The results provide insight that ``sf`` and ``awt`` may not be ideal for data that 
are not completely overlapping. Moreover, ``aws`` and ``awi`` obtained the same 
results while ``vwi`` outperformed the others in comparison to the reference data set.
Finally, `populR` performs much faster than `sf` and `areal` packages.
